## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
 - Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about developing a website with "Mobile-first" in mind. I think it made things a bit easier to visualize and map out despite working with a particularly small viewport. I was also able to apply most of my learnings about SASS, though I still have to work on how I lay down its structures properly. I used BEM as my naming conventions for my classes and I'm sure I made quite a mess with it LOL! I still have a long way to go to learn better semantics in both HTML and CSS, and in JavaScript as well.

Speaking of JavaScript, this is my second time working with it and my first time developing a website from scratch using only Vanilla JS without looking through any tutorials (except for some articles about the use of certain functions and methods). I think it was a bad idea not watching through tutorials on YouTube first, but its still quite an experience working on the logic of this website with literally having zero experience with JavaScript.

All in all, I learned a lot with this project and I sure hope I'll go the distance and learn more about JavaScript and its frameworks.

### Continued development

As I mentioned earlier, this is my first time developing a website using Vanilla JS, so I would like to improve my JavaScript skills by implementing its best practices.

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) - This youtuber inspired me to take on projects like this (Tip Calculator App) and gave me the motivation to start developing websites.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Of course, who could forget about one of the greatest websites ever created? W3Schools helped me learn ways to improve my flex and grid skills.
